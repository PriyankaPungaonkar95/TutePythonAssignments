num1 = int(input('Enter a first number: '))
num2 = int(input('Enter a second number: '))

#Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
# Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
print('Addition: ', addition)
print('Subtraction: ', subtraction)
print('Multiplication: ', multiplication)
